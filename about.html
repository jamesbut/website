        <p>Second year PhD student at the University of Liverpool under the supervision of Prof. Karl Tuyls, Prof. Rahul Savani & Dr. Paolo Paoletti.</p>

        <p>My research interests lie in the domain of Genetic Algorithms and Neuroevolution, however I have an interest in all things AI & Machine Learning.</p>

        <p>In 2017, I completed an MRes in Decision-Making Under Risk & Uncertainty for which I was awarded a Distinction and the second best project award. In 2016, I completed a BSc in Artificial Intelligence for which I was awarded a Class 1 and the overall best project award. Furthermore, my undergraduate thesis formed the basis for a full paper published at COMMA 2016. Both of these degrees were awarded by the University of Liverpool.</p>

        <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing squash; playing guitar in my function band; meditation; and watching and reading far too much material on Depth Psychology.</p>
